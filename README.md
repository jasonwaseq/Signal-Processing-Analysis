# Signal-Processing-Analysis

The assignments form a comprehensive journey through core signal processing concepts using MATLAB. They begin with foundational programming skills (Assignment 1), progress to signal manipulation and visualization in the time domain (Assignment 2), and then introduce system analysis through convolution and differential equations (Assignment 3). The focus then shifts to the frequency domain, starting with the Fourier Series for periodic signals (Assignment 4) and advancing to the continuous-time Fourier Transform for aperiodic signals (Assignment 5). The final assignment (Assignment 6) serves as a capstone, applying all previous concepts to real-world engineering challenges: designing an analog filter to remove 60 Hz noise from an ECG signal and implementing a full DSB-SC modulation/demodulation communication system. The overarching goal is to build proficiency in analyzing, transforming, and processing signals in both time and frequency domains using industry-standard computational tools.
